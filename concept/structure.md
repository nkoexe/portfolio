# Personal Portfolio Website

Site that showcases some of my works, with a homepage and an about/contact page. \
Less is more. Nothing that isn't strictly needed or doesn't serve a functional purpose shouldn't exist in the first place. \

### List of Pages needed

- Homepage with links to other main pages
- About with contacts
- List of works / projects, the actual portfolio part
  - Article detailing the specific thing

"Pages" are rendered in an a "singular page" kind of way with a smooth transition between them
(idk how to express, make it seem like everything is in one page eliminating browser snappy loading, but maintain different urls for each page)
